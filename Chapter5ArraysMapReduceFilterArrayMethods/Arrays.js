// Arrays are collection of some items which we can access through index.

// We can write names of different fruits in a single array. 

// We can make more than 1 object in a single array.

// We can put some numbers, some booleans and some objects all together in a single array.

// The advantage of array is we can store lots of values of different datatypes under a single variable.

// Arrays: 

    // Arrays are variables which can hold more than one value.

    //Example:

        // const fruits = ["banana", "apple", "grapes"]

        // And 

        // const a1 = [7, "Haris", false] // Note: The values inside a single array can be of different datatypes.

    // Accessing Values: 

        // let numbers = [1, 2, 7, 9]

        // numbers[0] // Note: This will give us value at 0 index which is 1 in the above numbers array.
        // numbers[1] // Note: This will give us value at 1st index which is 2 in the above numbers array.

    // Finding The Length:

        // let numbers = [1, 7, 9, 21]

        // numbers.length // Note: This will give us the value of 4.

    // Changing The Values:

        // let numbers = [7, 2, 40, 9]

        ///numbers[2] = 8 // Note: the above array named "numbers" now becomes [7, 2, 8, 9] // Note: Arrays are mutable means their values inside them can be changed.

// The type of an array is object.
