// 1) Expressions are values that we can assign to variables or they can be run as a program itself and that program will not throw any error, like !true, true,false, 7; etc. etc.

// 2) We do computation in most of the cases in program and for these computations we use operators.

// 3) 7 + 5 = 12 // In this example 7 and 5 are operands, + is operator and 12 is result.
        
// 4) !true //In this example ! is operator and true is operand and false is result.  

// Operators:

// 1) Arithmetic Operators:

        // let a = 45
        // let b = 4

    // *) + //(Plus) //Example: a + b //Result Of Example After Runing The Code: 49 
    // *) - //(Minus) //Example: a - b //Result Of Example After Runing The Code: 41
    // *) * //(Multiply) //Example: a * b //Result Of Example After Runing The Code: 180
    // *) / //(Divide) //Example: a / b //Result Of Example After Runing The Code: 11.25
    // *) ** //(Exponentiation) //Example: a ** b (45 power 4) //Result Of Example After Runing The Code: 4100625
    // *) % //(Modulus) //Example: a % b (Remainder) //Result Of Example After Runing The Code: 1
    // *) ++ //(Increment) //Example: a ++  //Result Of Example After Runing The Code: 45 but after the operation is performed the value of a will become 46. If ++a then the value that will print in console will be 46.
    // *) -- //(Decrement) //Example: a --  //Result Of Example After Runing The Code: 45 if the above increment example is not running at the same time (and above a--) in the same program (but after the operation is performed the value of a will become 44) but if the above increment operation is written above this decrement operation in the same program then the value will be 46 but after the operation is performed the value of a will become 45. If --a (without ++a written above --a in the same program) then the value that will print in console will be 44.


// 2) Assignment Operators: 

    // *) = //Example: ( x = 1) //Meaning: (x = y)
    // *) += //Example: (x += y) //Meaning: (x = x + y)
    // *) -= //Example: (x -= y) //Meaning: (x = x - y)
    // *) *= //Example: (x *= y) //Meaning: (x = x * y)
    // *) /= //Example: (x /= y) //Meaning: (x = x / y)
    // *) **= //Example: (x **= y) //Meaning: (x = x ** y)
    // *) %= //Example: (x %= y) //Meaning: (x = x % y)

// 3) Comparision Operators:

        // Comparision operators are used when we actually have to compare 2 things and in result we will get true or false.

    // *) == equal to
    // *) != not equal
    // *) === equal value and type
    // *) !== not equal value or not equal type
    // *) > greater than 
    // *) < less than
    // *) >= greater than or equal to
    // *) <= less than or equal to
    // *) ? ternary operator // same like if(){}else{} statement

// 4) Logical Operators: 

    // *) && logical and // if both conditions are true then it will return true else false
    // *) || logical or // if both conditions are false then it will return false else true
    // *) ! logical not // it will turn true to false and false to true (like !true will return false and !false will return true).

// Apart from these 4 operators we also have type operators (like typeof) and bitwise operators. Bitwise operators perform bit by bit operations on numbers. Bitwise convert numbers into binary and then perform bit by bit operations.

// 7 + 8 = 15 // In this example 7 and 8 are operands, + is operator and 15 is result.

// Comments: 

        // This is the syntax for single line comment in JavaScript.
        // and /* before the start and */ at the end of the text for converting whole text between them will be commented. This is called Multiline comment syntax.
