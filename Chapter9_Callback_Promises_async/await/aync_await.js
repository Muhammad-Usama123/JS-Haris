// We can make any function async and then we can await that async function's promise inside that async function. An async function always returns a promise. We can use .then() and .catch() with async functions cause they also always return promise. Async always returns a promise and wraps other non promises values with that too like if we also write inside that function "return 7" so it will wrap this value of 7 with the value of promise that it will always return. After using await we cannot use  .then() function with the variable in which we stored the awaited promise's value, like "let a = await abc" and if we write a.then() it will give us an error cause in the variable the value of the promise is stored not the promise. await only works inside async function. Async await function is just a more elegant syntax of getting the promise result than promise.then() plus its easier to read and write.
