// 1) javascript is dynamically typed language because we can change the type of variables in runtime means if we created a variable and stored a string data type value in it, later we can store numbers in it, arrays in it, objects init or any other datatype value in the runtime;

// 2) javascript is the example of dynamic typed language and maybe typescript is the example of static typed language (in this video the course provider gave the example of C language for static typed language) because in static typed language we first have to define the datatype of a variable and then we can store the value of that particular datatype that we defined with the declaration of variable and then we can perform any operation on it.

// 3) The set of rules that we follow for writing a program in javascript is called syntax same like the rules we follow during english speaking or writing (the grammar of english).

// 4) variables is a container use to store values.

// 5) variables gets stored in memory(RAM).

// 6) The value of a javascript variable can be changed during the execution of a program.

// 7) var a = 7 (in this example, 7 is called literal)(literal is a like a constant value)(let a = "Haris" in this example, "Haris" is called string literal )

// 8) let a = 7 (in this example, a is identifier, = is assignment operator and 7 is literal and this whole process of (let a = 7) is called the process of declaring variables)

// 9) rules for choosing variable names:

//      *) letters, digits, underscores and $ sign allowed.
//      *) The variable name must begins with $, _ or a letter.
//      *) javascript reserved words cannot be used as a variable name.
//      *) (let Harry = 7) and (let harry = 7) both of these are different variables because           javascript is case sensitive (but don't do this because it will reduce the readability of program).
